/**
 * The main interface to the Commo library.  An instance of this class
 * will provide most functionality of the library.  As a general rule, 
 * objects implementing any of the listener interfaces must remain valid 
 * from the time they are added until either they are removed using
 * the appropriate Commo method or this Commo instance is shutdown.
 *
 * Before creating the first instance of a Commo object, callers
 * must externally load and initialize the native libraries used internally
 * by Commo.  Specifically as of the time of this writing, this is libxml2,
 * openssl, and libcurl. openssl must be initialized to support use by multiple
 * threads. A method is provided here to do a compatible, default set of
 * initialization calls to these libraries.
 *
 * Since Commo 1.3.0, Java bindings for Commo may be built to load and
 * initialize native libraries automatically. This behavior, which is entirely
 * dictated at build time of the Commo library itself, replaces the need
 * to manually load and intialize libraries at the application level with
 * an automatic invocation of such when relevant public classes of the Commo
 * library are loaded. When using Commo configured in this manner, it is
 * assumed that all such native libraries for commo itself and all dependencies
 * will remain loaded, initialized, and valid for the lifetime of commo
 * use by the process.
 * Note also that the current auto-loading mechanism does not have a way
 * to catch and report errors to the using application. For applications
 * desiring greater control over library handling and error reporting, 
 * a build depending on the manual loading described in the prior paragraph
 * should be used by the application.
