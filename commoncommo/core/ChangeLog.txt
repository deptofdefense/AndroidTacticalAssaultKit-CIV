** Release 2020-09-29
NEW FEATURES
* File-based I/O is now performed through a layer of abstraction allowing
  the client application to supply an alternate file open/read/close
  mechanism. If no alternate I/O implementation is registered,
  the default implementation uses the underlying OS/libc's simple file IO 
  to mimic behavior of previous Commo releases.
* TCP port used for http interactions with TAK server (primarily mission
  package transfers via a TAK server) is now configurable (similar to how
  the same port setting for https interactions was in prior versions).  The
  default for this new setting is port 8080, which emulates the behavior of
  prior Commo versions.

API CHANGES
* Java only: Addition of Commo::registerFileIOProvider() and
  Commo::deregisterFileIOProvider() plus supporting interfaces to implement
  the new file-based I/O abstraction feature detailed above.  Support
  for other languages is not planned and will default to the legacy file
  I/O behavior.
* Added Commo::setMissionPackageHttpPort() to provide the TAK server http 
  port use described in the new feature, above.


** Release 2020-06-09
NEW FEATURES
* The "CloudClient" API now includes a method by which to request
  that a remote resource (file or collection) be deleted.

BUG FIXES
* Fix a logging message associated with the https server to report
  the correct old port when the port is changed. It was reporting
  the old port as the current http server port.
* Fix default connection timeout used by https proxy.  Was 20 seconds, now
  90 seconds for consistency with prior (pre-https) mission package api

API CHANGES
* Addition of CloudClient::deleteResourceInit() and
  CloudIOOperation::CLOUDIO_OP_DELETE. These are related to the new remote
  resource delete feature
* Win32 C++/CLI Only: Added Commo::SetMissionPackageLocalHttpsParams()
  and Commo::GenerateSelfSignedCertificate() to C++/CLI bindings. See
  2020-05-27 notes for more on this new API.


** Release 2020-05-27
NEW FEATURES
* Data package transfers directly from device to device (no TAK server
  involved) now prefer to use https when enabled on the sending device
  and the receiving device supports it.  This behavior is invoked on
  receipt if a few new tags in the CoT message initiating the file transfer
  are present. For the next few releases, commo will support interop with
  older versions by continuing to host sent files on both http and https
  and setting these new tags to signal current version receivers that https
  is available.  In some future release, the send path will set only one of
  these new tags (which signals the transfer is peer to peer to help
  receiver determine correct trust parameters versus those that are hosted
  on a TAK server), will begin sending https URLs directly, and will
  terminate the availability of the http server hosting files to send.

API CHANGES
* Added Commo::setMissionPackageLocalHttpsParams() to configure the
  https server. Applications need to invoke this to enable the https
  functionality.
* Added Commo::generateSelfSignedCertifate() as a convenience to generate
  a certificate for the device to use.


** Release 2020-04-07
BUG FIXES
* Data package uploads to a TAK server would cause commo to not clean
  up properly during shutdown likely resulting in a crash. This problem
  first appeared in release 2018-05-08


** Release 2020-02-13
BUG FIXES
* When translating from TAK Protocol (protobuf) back to XML,
  the "opex" attribute of the <event> element was erroneously
  being represented as the "access" attribute. (ATAK-12302)


** Release 2020-02-12
API CHANGES
* Win32 only: CloudIOProtocol enumeration updated to add FTP(S)

BUG FIXES
* Win32 only: Querying local file size (done as part of mission package
  transfers, simple file uploads, and cloud interface uploads) would leak
  open files.  This could also cause files to remain "locked" for reading.


** Release 2019-12-10
NEW FEATURES
* Cloud file service client has been augmented with FTP and FTPS transfer
  capabilities

API CHANGES
* CloudIOProtocol enumeration has been extended to add FTP and FTPS
  protocols.  See above new feature.

BUG FIXES
* Long directory listings using an owncloud client could report incomplete
  results or nonsensical errors.


** Release 2019-11-18
BUG FIXES
* Time values encoded in TAK Protocol and subsequently converted back to
  strings now include the full value down to millisecond.  Previously
  it only converted whole seconds back to strings. (ATAK-11847)


** Release 2019-10-31
NEW FEATURES
* Cloud file service client has been added with ability to send files,
  get files, make folders, list folders, and rename files/folders.
  Owncloud is the only supported service at the moment.

API CHANGES
* Numerous classes added to support new cloud feature: CloudClient and
  CloudIO are the main ones, with CloudCollectionEntry and several enums
  to support.  See cloudio.h.  Currently only available for Java/JNI outside
  core.

BUG FIXES
* (Java/JNI only) Fix small memory leak in mission package transfer support
* Explicitly initialize simple file transfer id's to start at 0

MISC CHANGES
* Type safety changes to support windows 64 bit compile
* Add windows 64 bit compile configuration to MSVC project files


** Release 2019-07-15
API CHANGES
* Commo::generateKeyCryptoString() now takes a key length argument.
  Existing callers can use 2048 as keyLength to get behavior equivalent
  to prior versions.


** Release 2019-05-24
BUG FIXES
* Fix interface scanning to correctly locate interfaces named "tun1"


** Release 2019-05-15
BUG FIXES
* Fix <precisionlocation> tag not being restored properly on receipt
  of v1 protobuf optimized version.


** Release 2018-12-19
API CHANGES
* Commo::broadcastCoT, Commo::sendCoT, Commo::sendCoTTcpDirect,
  Commo::sendCoTToServerMissionDest, and Commo::sendCoTServerControl
  not return COMMO_ILLEGAL_ARGUMENT if the XML message is greater
  than the maximum allowed CoT message size (currently 64k)


** Release 2018-12-14
BUG FIXES
* Reduce logging that occurs when streaming connection message
  parsing buffer capacity will be exceeded and/or TAK protocol magic
  byte is not found where expected.
   

*** Release 2018-12-10
NEW FEATURES
* (Linux/Android only: Add "fake" addressing for interfaces ppp0-ppp9


*** Release 2018-11-12
BUG FIXES
* Streaming TAK server connection timeouts were ignoring the amount of time
  that the initial SSL handshake would take. In very infrequent circumstances,
  the connection attempt could get stuck if the remote end accepted the TCP
  connection but stalls completing the SSL handshake. The connection timeout
  now monitors the handshake process and the time to complete it is
  limited by the connection timeout as well.
* Fix a memory leak in the translation to/from protobuf (TAK Protocol)


*** Release 2018-09-27
NEW FEATURES
* Ability to set preference on what type of endpoint should be used for
  contacts known by both mesh (local/direct) means and streaming TAK server.
  By default, mesh (local) endpoints are preferred to be compatible with
  prior behavior.

API CHANGES
* Commo::setPreferStreamEndpoint(bool) was added to support the above new
  feature.

MISC CHANGES
* OpenSSL and libcurl dependencies updated - core internal implementation
  updated to match new OpenSSL API.
* Additional logging added around intentional SSL connection disconnects
* Win32 Only: OpenSSL library names have changed. libeay32.dll is now
  libcrypto-1_1.dll and ssleay32.dll is now libssl32-1_1.dll
  

*** Release 2018-09-12
BUG FIXES
* Java/JNI only: Fix crash that would occur if setCryptoKeys() is
  called with NULL arguments


*** Release 2018-09-10
NEW FEATURES
* Added ability to create datagram sockets that listen for generic data
  and post it to a new generic data listener interface. 
* Added ability to encrypt and decrypt non-TAK server CoT traffic.  This is
  done using a symmetric cipher using pre-shared keys.  If enabled, it is
  used for both receive and send on all CoT inbound and outbound interfaces
  that are not TAK server based (TAK server encryption has been supported for
  a long time). See Commo::setCryptoKeys()

API Changes
* Commo::addInboundInterface() now receives an additional argument to indicate
  if the interface should be used for receiving CoT messages or generic data
* New interface: GenericDataListener
* Added Commo::addGenericDataListener() and Commo::removeGenericDataListener()
* CoTMessageListener::cotMessageReceived() will now populate rxIfaceEndpointId
  for udp and tcp messages received (previously always NULL for these, and
  non-null for streams).  The format is "*:portnumber:udp" for UDP and 
  "*:portnumber:tcp" for TCP, where portnumber is the integral port number
  of the port on which the data was received.
* Commo::setCryptoKeys() has been added to support the above-described new
  encryption feature.

BUG FIXES
* Win32/C++CLI Bindings: Translate System::String's to native strings
  using UTF-8 encoding where appropriate.  Fixes relevant parts of WTK-3729.


*** Release 2018-08-02
BUG FIXES
* Fix a bug that was causing data elements carried as double's in TAK protocol
  to contain only 3, 4, or 5 digits of precision after the decimal point.
  This fix forces 8 digits of precision after the point.  This most notably
  is a concern for latitude/longitude data elements, but also impacts 
  hae, ce, le, speed, and course.


*** Release 2018-07-20
NEW FEATURES
* Ability to force advertisement of local mesh network endpoint to a UDP
  endpoint instead of the TCP default.  Use of this functionality is intended
  for very restricted and specific audiences only, thus should not be used
  widely.

API Changes
* Add Commo::setAdvertiseEndpointAsUdp() to implement the above new feature.
  Presently only available in JNI bindings and native core.


*** Release 2018-07-18
MISC. CHANGES
* TAK Protocol v1 changed to make contact endpoint optional to
  conserve additional bandwidth
  - THIS CHANGE MUST BE APPLIED TO ALL PRODUCTS PRIOR TO RELEASE
    Do not use 2018-06-25 or 2018-07-17 in release products!
* Remove debugging output for TAK protocol negotiation


*** Release 2018-07-17
NEW FEATURES
* Internally created threads are now named

BUG FIXES
* Use SSL configuration of the server from which a mission package transfer
  request is received if the sending device's UID specified in the transfer
  request message does not have an associated stream endpoint. This is
  primarily intended to allow transfer requests from "fake" contacts
  (TAK server in particular) to succeed (ATAK-8229)


*** Release 2018-06-25
NEW FEATURES
* TAK Protocol Support:
    - Entirely new device-to-device protocol support added that uses
      Google's protocol buffers as an encoding for common cot event elements
    - On mesh networks:
        - System starts out using new TAK protocol for sending outgoing
          messages
        - Each system that supports this protocol advertises this support
          periodically on the network
        - If a system sees another device that does not support the new
          protocol, it will fall back to the legacy XML-based communication.
          Once the legacy device disappears from the network for a modest
          time, new protocol use will resume.
        - Receipt of XML works always, so any legacy devices will always be
          seen immediately
        - On networks with old and new devices, there may be a latency of a
          few minutes with this negotiation takes place until new devices
          fall back to sending out XML and are seen by old devices
    - When connecting to TAK servers:
        - The initial connection is always legacy XML based
        - TAK servers supporting the new protocol send a special message
          to indicate such; this message is consumed by Commo
        - Commo swaps the session over to the new protocol once this message
          is seen.
        - If connected to a server not supporting the protocol, the session
          will simply continue to use legacy XML
    - New protocol collapses the sizes of typical SA messages by about 50%
* Win32 only: Visual Studio projects updated to VS2015 format and tools

API Changes
* Java/JNI only:  Added cotXmlToTakproto() and takprotoToCotXml() to Commo.
  These are utility functions to convert XML to TAK protocol binary blobs and
  vice-versa.
* Added Commo::getBroadcastProto() - this returns the version of the
  TAK protocol currently in use by the mesh network broadcast system as
  derived from the negotiation process.
  


*** Release 2018-05-08
NEW FEATURES
* Add ability to set UDP socket receive timeout.  This controls the period
  after which no data has received on the socket where the system
  both rebuilds that socket and issues any necessary multicast joins.
  Prior to this feature, this timeout was fixed at 30 seconds (which is the
  new default)
* Significant rework of mission package send/receive features to provided
  some new functionality (see API Changes):
  - Easier to use and more complete progress tracking for sends and receives
  - More detailed error reporting
  - Ability to disable or change port number of local web server
  - Ability to enable or disable sending files via TAK servers
  - Ability to set https port used when contacting a TAK server's web 
    interface during mission package transfers


API Changes
* Added setUdpNoDataTimeout() to Commo class to provide above mentioned
  UDP timeout feature.
* Commo::enableMissionPackageIO() is now Commo::setupMissionPackageIO() and
  only serves to provide client-side interface for MP IO. The "enable/disable"
  functionality is now separate (read on).  The function of the 
  MissionPackageIO interface is largely the same as before.  This function
  no longer receives the local web server port number. The default state
  of the local web server (and point to point sends of mission packages)
  is now *disabled* - see below for how to enable.
* New function: Commo::setMissionPackageLocalPort(int) - sets the local
  web server's port number. Unlike the prior interface, this also allows
  the local web server to be disabled or enabled at runtime, as well as
  change the port number.
* New function: Commo::setMissionPackageViaServerEnable(bool) enables
  or disables sending of MPs via TAK servers when appropriate.
* New function: Commo::setMissionPackageHttpsPort(int) to set port number
  used to contact https interface of TAK servers
* Sending mission package function call changes: the process for sending
  MPs has gone from a single function call (Commo::sendMissionPackage()) to 2
  function calls, one which initializes the transfer and provides the
  ID used for progress tracking (Commo::sendMissionPackageInit()), and one
  which starts the transfer (Commo::sendMissionPackageStart())
* The MissionPackageTransferStatus enumeration has all values redefined.
  Several new values have been added and the old values have had some
  redefined usage in the API (see below).
* MissionPackageTransferStatusUpdate has been renamed to 
  MissionPackageSendStatusUpdate and several changes have been made to
  its members and meanings.
* New class - MissionPackageReceiveStatusUpdate - used in callbacks
  for MP receiving progress events.
* MissionPackageIO interface changes:
  a. All functions reflect the changes to MissionPackageTransferStatus
  b. missionPackageReceiveComplete() removed; receive completion is now
     part of the new receive progress callback
  c. missionPackageReceiveStatusUpdate() added; indicates receive progress
     and completion
  d. missionPackageSendStatus() updated to use newly redefined
     MissionPackageSendStatusUpdate class. Now provides additional progress
     information and details
* Obj-C only: Add bindings for CSR generation functions that were previously
  added to other platforms but missing from Obj-C.
* Java only: JNI Library loading changed to remove internal loading. 
  Applications must now load library manually. Convenience call to do
  initialization of third party libraries no longer loads native libraries;
  function name is changed to reflect this.  Load checking is no longer
  done in Commo constructor; load check is on application now.

BUG FIXES
* Remove ability for Commo::enableSimpleFileIO() to accidentally throw
  invalid_argument; instead, catch and return appropriate code.
* Java/JNI Bindings: Fix a small memory leak when sending mission packages
* Java Bindings: Fix documentation errors for enableSimpleFileIO()
* C++ CLI bindings: add simple file IO interface
* C++ CLI bindings: Fix bug where Commo::SetStreamMonitorEnabled() was not
  actually doing anything


*** Release 2018-03-11
API Changes
* generateKeystoreCryptoString now takes an array/list of CA certificates
  to allow for intermediate CA certs in the trust chain.


*** Release 2018-03-09
NEW FEATURES
* Add new functions to Commo class to enable generation of
  certificate signing requests (CSRs) to TAK server and processing
  of said certificates when they return from the server.
  This is a port of the ATAK function provided by "crypto-utils".

API Changes
* Add generateKeyCryptoString, generateCSRCryptoString, 
  generateKeystoreCryptoString, and freeCryptoString. These implement
  the above described new features.
  (not yet available for Obj-C, coming soon)
  

*** Release 2018-02-27
API Changes
* iOS/Obj-C only:  Change this platform to use named interface mode
  instead of MAC address interface identification.  Update
  Obj-c bindings to match this change.


*** Release 2018-02-12
API Changes
* Internal implementation now uses a different library for thread 
  implementation (pgscthread instead of PGSC_Utils's Thread lib).
  Clients should notice no change, however builds will need to be modified
  as follows:
    - All platforms: pgscthreads is now needed as a sibling to commoncommo
      Clone pgscthread from
      https://git.pargovernment.com/PAR-Government/pgscthread.git
      as a sibling to the commoncommo module.
    - Win32 only: Common commo DLL now will have a dependency on
      pgscthread.dll instead of Thread.dll.  pthreads DLL is no
      longer used by commo!
  "takthirdparty" will also now build pgscthread as a dependency for
  commoncommo instead of PGSC_Utils.
  This is a substantial change to the internals of the library. Upgrades
  should be performed only at the start of a development cycle where
  sufficient testing will be observed. If you need a version prior to this,
  use a previously tagged release or the tag pre-pgscthreads.

BUG FIXES
* Obj-C only: Fix a typo in the obj-c bindings


*** Release 2018-01-24
NEW FEATURES
* Linux/Android only:  Support tun0 and tun1 devices
                  via "fake" mac/hw addresses since these typically do not
                  have mac addresses of their own
BUG FIXES
* Win32/CLI only: Fix an issue with Commo::RemoveContactPresenceListener
                  Make some changes to how things are torn down to try
                  to resolve spurious crashes


*** Release 2018-01-12
BUG FIXES
* Android/Linux only: Fix a problem related to scanning of network
  interfaces that could result in an interface not ever being able to be
  used for outbound datagram sockets.  The nature of the problem is such that
  it is dependent on memory layout and does not appear to affect ARM
  architectures, only x86, and even then only seen rarely outside of
  emulators.  x86 emulators seem most impacted.  Affected installations will
  display a log message like the following every 15 seconds or so: "Unable to
  build outbound datagram socket (address 111.111.111.111); will retry later"


*** Release 2018-01-02
BUG FIXES
* Fix a regression introduced with 2017-11-28 release that caused potentional
  crashing when connecting to TAK servers with SSL enabled.


*** Release 2017-11-28
API Changes
* Win32/CLI only: Commo instances created by CLI bindings will
  always use "name" address mode. Physical interfaces must now
  be created with interface (Network Adapter) names instead of
  MAC/ethernet/physical addresses, since these are non-unique.
  AddBroadcastInterface() and AddInboundInterface() have had their
  method signatures changed to accept the name as a String rather than
  the MAC/Phys address as a byte array.
  PhysicalNetInterface has been updated to have its internal identifier
  changed from a byte array MAC/Phys address to a String name/id.
  See WTK-2427 for more background and detail.
* New: Commo::enableSimpleFileIO(), Commo::simpleFileTransferInit(), 
  Commo::simpleFileTransferStart() and the
  SimpleFileIO interface in support of the new SimpleFileIO feature (see below)

NEW FEATURES
* Core only: Commo constructor has a new argument to determine the types of 
  addresses used for physical interfaces. In the past, addresses
  for physical interfaces were always the MAC/Ethernet address of
  the interface. This argument now supports setting the Commo
  instance up to work with interface names as the identifying
  "address" instead.  Name mode is presently only implemented for
  Win32.
* SimpleFileIO: means by which to do a simple file transfer easily.
  A simple file transfer, for the purposes of Commo, is an upload to
  or download from a remote server application of a file using a
  commonly available network protocol.  Currently supported protocols
  are FTP and FTPS only. More protocols may be added in the future.
  See Commo class's enableSimpleFileIO(), simpleFileTransferInit(),
  and simpleFileTransferStart() calls,
  as well as the SimpleFileIO interface and associated status enumeration.

BUG FIXES
* Fix a potential program crash due to an
  uncaught exception that could occur when building the auth document
  for authenticated connection to a TAK server.  Very unlikely to occur
  except in drastically low memory conditions.

  


*** Released 2017-09-26

API CHANGES
* Win32/CLI only:  Added rxEndpointId argument to binding for
  cotMessageReceived(). See 2017-07-10 for more.
* Add streaming endpoint id argument to sendCoTToServerMissionDest() to
  optionally indicate which servers to send the mission data too.
* Add streaming endpoint id argument to sendCoTServerControl() to
  optionally indicate which servers to send the mission data too.
* Obj-C only:  Change name of sendCoTToServerMissionDest and
               sendCoTToServerControlMessage to better reflect new parameters
  

*** Released 2017-08-04

BUG FIXES
* Correct undefined behavior if addBroadcastInterface is given an invalid
  destination multicast address.


*** Released 2017-07-27

API CHANGES
* MissionPackageTransferStatusUpdate objects referred to in callbacks to
  MissionPackageIO::missionPackageSendStatus() may now have a NULL recipient,
  but only if the transfer whose status is being reported was initiated via
  the new sendMissionPackage() variant that sends to a TAK server rather than
  one or more contacts.  See NEW FEATURES.
  

NEW FEATURES
* It is now possible to direct a mission package send at a specific TAK server.
  Much like sending to one or more contacts known via a TAK server,
  the server will be queried to see if the MP exists and uploaded if not.
  In either event, the client application is notified as to the completion.


BUG FIXES
* Obj-C and Win32 only: Corrected documentation on "recipient" member of 
  MissionPackageTransferStatusUpdate. It erroneously stated that this
  was the callsign of the recipient to which the update pertains 
  (it is actually the UID).
* Avoid a very-hard-to-trigger memory leak in Commo::sendMissionPackage()
  This can only be triggered by very odd combinations of send destinations
  and lucky network conditions.
* iOS only: Fix a compilation error introduced in or near 2016-11-18 release


*** Released 2017-07-24

BUG FIXES
* File transfer (n)acks will no longer include a <contact> element.
  In addition, <contact> elements in received file transfer
  (n)acks will be ignored. Versions prior to this, and old
  versions of ATAK that did not use commo, would set the callsign
  attribute of the file transfer (n)ack to contain the UID of the
  (n)acking device, rather than the callsign itself.  This confused
  contact callsign tracking (which is vital for TAK server
  communications). ATAK no longer adds a <contact> to (n)acks,
  thus commo is removing to match.  We are ignoring the <contact>
  on these messages to better improve interop with old versions of
  commo and ATAK (since we know their callsigns are likely wrong).
  See WTK-2132 for more info.
* Callsigns included in file sharing URLs are now URL escaped before
  the file transfer request URL is sent out.  Previously this
  was only done for TAK server-based URLs, but it is now done
  for local URLs as well. See ATAK-6593.


*** Released 2017-07-10

API CHANGES
* CoTMessageListener::cotMessageReceived() now receives 2 arguments 
  instead of 1. See NEW FEATURES

NEW FEATURES
* CoTMessageListener::cotMessageReceived() will now receive both
  the message and an identifier of the NetworkInterface upon which
  it was received.  Currently this is implemented only for
  StreamingNetworkInterface's and exposed beyond core
  only for the Java language bindings.
* Clean up compilation on very old versions of CentOS


*** Released 2017-06-08

NEW FEATURES
* A mechanism to "workaround quirks" of various runtime platforms that
  is not automatically detectable was added to the core system.
  Quirks are exposed only on platforms to which they are relevant.
  Currently only one quirk workaround is available, for the Magtab
  device's multicast sending oddities.  It is exposed in the JNI
  bindings only as it is only run on Android.

BUG FIXES
* Fix resource exhaustion check for inbound message parsing on
  tcp interfaces.  This bug, prior to being fixed, effectively
  rendered the resource exhaustion check useless.
  Inbound messages are now capped at 500kB



*** Released 2017-01-31

NEW FEATURES
* An overloaded version of addBroadcastInterface() was added that allows
  one to add a broadcast destination that is a unicast address.  Because
  there is no need to tie unicast sends to a specific outbound physical
  address, this variant of addBroadcastInterface() also does not require
  a physical (hardware) address to identify such.
  Note that passing a multicast address to this variant will result
  in an error return.
* In support of the above feature and in attempt to make endpoint
  derivation on the receiving end be as reliable as possible,
  a new "use the source address of this message" endpoint specification
  has been added.  This will appear in a cot contact element as
  endpoint="unusedstring:port:srctcp". The "protocol" of srctcp
  specifies to the remote commo implementation that the source address
  of the cot message should be used as the endpoint host portion,
  coupled with the specified TCP port.


NEW FEATURES - Linux/Android only
* Add yet another way to get the physical/MAC address of a network interface;
  we now query netlink for this information when we query IP address info.
  If this fails, we fall back to the other two already existing methods
  (SIOCGIFHWADDR and reading out of /sys, in that order).


BUG FIXES
* Commo::addBroadcastInterface() would erroneously accept a unicast
  address in the mcastAddress parameter.  While this would sometimes
  function to broadcast to a unicast address on a given port, 
  this functionality was not guaranteed to work.  Furthermore it was
  inconsistent with the API documentation and didn't make a lot of sense
  overall.  Beginning with this release, passing a unicast address
  to the existing multicast variant of this function with result in
  an error return.
* Fix a very unlikely but nonetheless possible invalid memory access
  that could cause a crash when enumerating network interfaces (Android only)


*** Released 2016-12-08

NEW FEATURES
* Increased logging level of TCP listening socket creation and failures
  to bind to desired ports.

BUG FIXES
* Scanning of interface IPs will now detect and properly react to
  an interface whose IP changes suddenly without any substantial
  unconfigured/downtime in between.  Symptoms of this problem may
  have been lack of SA reception after IP change accompanied by
  many log messages indicating failure to join multicast groups
  on the old IP of the interface.  This event is also logged akin
  to hardware up/down events.
* Fix possible crash if an inbound tcp interface was requested to be
  added (addTcpInboundInterface()), the port was already in use, and then
  subsequently some other TCP traffic occurred.
* Fix return value of addTcpInboundInterface() to return success if the
  port is not immediately open on the local system, and initiate continued
  retries to get the port.  Previously it would leave the interface in a
  partly initialized state and never retry, possibly leading to the
  bug mentioned immediately above this one.
  



*** Released 2016-11-30

NEW FEATURES
* Added function setMulticastLoopbackEnabled() to allow controlling if
  outbound multicasts are looped back to the local system or not.

BUG FIXES
* None


*** Released 2016-11-18

NEW FEATURES
* Commo will now add the "creatorUid" parameter to the missionupload URL when
  sending files to a TAK server for mission package transfers.  This results
  in the sender's callsign being displayed in the Enterprise Sync web view
  of the TAK server.
* An option to allow "address reuse" on UDP sockets was added.
  This allows other applications to bind to the same UDP port that inbound
  interfaces in Commo are listening on.  NOTE: This will cause unreliable
  delivery of any unicasted packets to the commo interface.  This option
  should only be used when inbound udp interfaces are solely expecting
  multicast traffic.
  This option is currently only implemented/supported on Windows and Linux;
  because of this has been intentionally omitted from the Obj-C
  bindings.



BUG FIXES
* A device with a space or other non-URL-legal character in their callsign
  would fail to receive mission packages in many situations due to the
  callsign being placed in the URL without escaping.  The Callsign is now
  URL escaped when used in a URL.
* Attempting to send a mission package to a TAK-server-known recipient with
  a space or other non-URL-legal character in the file name would fail to
  upload to the TAK server.  Filename is now URL escaped when used in
  a URL.
* Adding an input interface with an array of multicast addresses 
  that contained 2 or more of the same address would previously succeed;
  this was unintentional and should've triggered an error. It now does so.
* Win32 CLI bindings only:  Marshal file name and transfer name string as UTF-8
  to produce compliant cot message for file send. See WTK-1249
* Commo will now strip any <_flow-tags_> element found under the 
  <detail> element.
  This is to ensure transit through TAK servers.
  See https://jira.pargovernment.net/browse/WTK-1434 for more detail.


*** Released 2016-08-24

>>> IMPORTANT NOTES FOR THIS RELEASE <<<
* TCP Endpoints are now the advertised endpoint in broadcast/multicast
  messages!  Prior versions of Commo advertised an endpoint of
  "ipaddr:6969:udp". This version advertises as "ipaddr:4242:tcp".
  To interoperate correctly you MUST add an inbound TCP interface on port
  4242!
* To interoperate with older versions (and of course to get the widely used
  multicasts for the TAK family) you will want to continue using a UDP inbound
  interface on port 6969.
* Several API calls have changed and are detailed below.

BUG FIXES
* Connecting to an authenticated TAK server with a username or password
  containing characters regarded as "special" by XML would fail.
  Particularly, this is the '&' character. Quoting is now performed
  on the authentication message sent to TAK server.
* Documentation added for methods of InterfaceStatusListener
* Several optimizations to UDP datagram reception
* (Windows only): Multicast sending to an address that is also one
  for which we subscribe to receive on will no longer result in
  receiving a copy of the sent data locally.


NEW FUNCTIONALITY
* Ability to set TCP connection timeout. This is used when making any TCP
  connection to a remote host (for streaming/TAK server, including SSL, or
  remote contact's TCP endpoint **except for** connections associated
  with mission package file transfer; use the mission package timeout
  setting for this.
* Stream monitoring: Streaming (TAK Server) interfaces are monitored
  continuously. If no data is received on a given interface
  after an implementation-defined period of time, a special "ping"
  CoT message is sent to the remote server. Servers will reply to this
  with a "pong" message and the timeout is reset. If no response (or no
  new data) arrives after another implementation defined period of time,
  the connection is torn down and we attempt to reconnect under the
  assumption the connection is somehow no longer functional.  This function
  defaults to on, but can be disabled via a new API call.
* TCP Support: Commo now supports listening on TCP ports and sending
  to other remote devices via TCP connection. 
  - New methods {add,remove}TcpInboundInterface allow creation and
    removal of local TCP listening interfaces. These work just like the
    existing {add,remove}InboundInterface methods for UDP, but are instead
    for TCP. Unlike the UDP counterparts, they DO NOT require any
    specific physical interface specification with MAC addresses; they merely
    require a local port number. Of course they do not support receiving
    multicasts either.  These interfaces are intended for the
    "connect-send-quit" style of message passing.
  - Registered CoTMessageListeners will receive messages sent to TCP inbound
    interfaces just like traditional (UDP) inbound interfaces.
  - sendCoT(ContactUID) supports contacts whose endpoints are TCP-based now
* Notification of failure to send a CoT message:  a new listener interface, 
  CotSendFailureListener, can be registered via new API calls.
  These listeners will be notified of any detectable failure to
  asynchronously send a directed (non-broadcast) CoT message.  This is
  of course only possible with TCP-based remote destinations. The callback
  of this interface is expected to be advisory in nature and not an
  absolutely reliable and traceable means by which to track message send
  success or failure. ATAK uses this to present simply "heads up"
  notifications to the user.  The registered Logger is still used in 
  these types of situations - this is just a means to get user-friendly
  advisory messages about a specific subset of failure notifications.
* Ability to send via specific methods: The existing 
  sendCoT() and broadcastCoT() methods have had optional parameters/second
  forms now that allow the send/broadcast to be restricted to a specific
  method of transmission, namely: streaming/tak server, 
  point-to-point/mesh network, or both. The existing behavior (and default
  method of) these functions remains the same - we try to send via
  the most appropriate of all known methods to reach the recipient.  This
  function was added for some very particular corner cases in ATAK and you
  likely will not need to use it.
* A new API call to send directly to a remote TCP host/IP and port.  THIS
  CALL IS DEPRECATED AND SHOULD NOT BE USED, as marked in the API
  docs.  Use sendCoT(ContactUID) instead. It was added to address
  some legacy function in ATAK until it they can be reworked.
* A new API call to send a CoT message to all connected streaming interfaces
  (TAK servers) with special addressing such that the TAK server processes
  it as a control message.  What uses this, how it is used in practice, and
  what the TAK server is not something I am aware of; you likely will not
  need this until whatever that feature is matures more.
* "Contacts" configured via configKnownEndpointContact can now have a
  multicast endpoint that will function properly (goes out all interfaces
  not just whatever interface is default route for multicast traffic on
  the host system)
* A new API call to send a CoT message to all connected streaming interfaces
  (TAK servers) addressed not to specific contacts, but to a specific
  mission identifier was added. This is also something that I am not
  entirely sure of how it is used in practice.
* Contacts known solely via TAK server endpoints will now be passed
  as an argument to any registered ContactPresenceListener's
  contactRemoved() if the connection to the server is lost or if the
  streaming interface to that server is removed; the contact
  will be considered as "gone" for future sendCoT() and similar function
  invocations until they are rediscovered on the network.
* A new callback method has been added to the InterfaceStatusListener
  interface.  This method is called when an attempt to bring up an interface
  unexpectedly fails for some reason (host unreachable, etc.) or if an
  established interface is unexpectedly brought down forcibly by some error
  (timeout, I/O error, etc).  You can safely no-op this callback if you
  are not interested in the error information.  Currently this is only
  actually implemented for streaming (TAK server) connections.
* addStreamingInterface() now returns more detail on what failed.  The
  exact mechanism by which this is returned depends on the language binding
  (Java uses exception details, obj-c uses CommoResult error code, CLI tbd).
  Most notable here, this allows you to detect cert password mismatches or
  invalid certificate structure/format.
* CommoResult has a few new constants added to the enum to support the
  additional error detail from addStreamingInterface(). Only addStreaming
  presently uses these new constants; all existing APIs have remained the
  same. Depending on language binding compiler settings, it may be necessary
  to add additional case/default settings to switch()-like statements,
  however, if the toolchain checks that all enum cases are covered.


Obj-C only changes:
  - Clarification on a number of existing methods
  - Set correct default state of properties in the Commo interface
  - Add ability to set number of attempts to try downloading
    a mission package from a remote host on receipt of a request to download
  - Add ability to set timeout for connections to remote hosts to download
    mission package files
  - Add ability to set data transfer timeout (elapsed time of no data
    transfer progresss  after which connection is aborted and transfer
    is retried)
  - Add ability to add "known endpoint contacts" - this lets you add
    a contact with an endpoint that you have some pre-knowledge of and
    will not discover on the network, enabling you to send to them
    via any normal method which uses a ContactUID. Note that this only
    functions for UDP endpoints at this time as noted in the API doc.
    Currently only WinTAK uses this function - Rob can probably 
    explain how it is used there if needed.
