javasqlite-pgsc - Modified version of the native portions only of
                  javasqlite-20140624 from
                  http://www.ch-werner.de/javasqlite. Modification history
                  unknown. Copy of raster/pgsc/spatialite/exp-jsql.tar.gz.
                  Adds spatialite support and changes the package
                  name to match those employed by the Java counterpart
                  used by ATAK, maybe other changes as well

*** pthreads binary bundle:

pthreads-win32.zip: v2.9.1-release, rebuilt by Chris Lawrence using VS2013


*** Patches:
proj-pgsc.patch - Minor change to jni interface. Derived from old
                  raster/pgsc/spatialite/exp-spatialite.sh script
openssl-pgsc.patch - Pass PERL var to recursive make calls.
                  Disable check for windows paths since we use cygwin perl
libmicrohttpd-pgsc-win32.patch - Changes the VC++ project file
                     to build static libraries against the DLL-based
                     runtimes so that result can be used in other
                     DLLs or apps built against the DLL runtime
expat-pgsc.patch - Fix include for close(), read(), etc. on ios-arm64
                   Add android arm64 to autoconf
expat-pgsc-winproj.patch - Add 64-bit build config to MSVC project files
libspatialite-pgsc.patch - Android compatibility for package's autoconf
                   Fix several places where library would have undefined
                   references if OMIT_ICONV was defined (which we do)
                   Fixes makefile.vc (windows) to not hardcode the path
                   to supporting headers and libs
                   Adjust config-msvc.h to match our setup (copied from old
                     build in [CVS]/SpatiaLite)
                   Fix buggy macro test for MSVC compilers around alternate
                     rint() implementation inclusion
                   Fix iconv use on ios
                   Add android arm64 to autoconf
libiconv-pgsc.patch - Fix detection of LD when running on a windows/cygwin
                   build host and crossing for Android.  Fixes broken line
                   endings during configure runs and deriving vars for libtool
curl-pgsc.patch - Fix detection of LD and a few other things that break
                  when building for android (or anything using configure)
                  on cygwin with text mount
protobuf-pgsc.patch - Fix detection of LD when running on a windows/cygwin
                   build host and crossing for Android.  Fixes broken line
                   endings during configure runs and deriving vars for libtool
sqlcipher-pgsc.patch - Add Android host detection and arm64 to config.sub, and
                   ability to build for android in cygwin
ogdi-pgsc.patch - Numerous hacks to ogdi's ancient and obtuse build
                   system for both Windows and Android and Linux.
                   Also removes RPC parts since we don't want that as a 
                   dependency.
geos-pgsc.patch - Add support for newer nmake version in VS2015 Update 3 and
                   building for android from windows/cygwin
libkml-pgsc.patch - Fix various issues with libkml
libkml-pgsc-postac.patch - Fixes applied after autoconf is run
libkml-pgsc-win*.patch - Fixes for Windows project files (mostly adding 64-bit)



*** Building pdfium binary bundles:
The "pdfium" library uses Google's chromium tools for building.  It is fairly
fickle and requires very specific setups.  Moreover, the vanilla pdfium
distribution is not suited for use inside gdal (which is how TAK and TTP
uses it), gdal expects an older fork of pdfium (several years older than
current google repository), and current google pdfium uses C++ constructs
unsupported by the TTP-required version of the Android NDK.
Due to these restrictions, pdfium is held in takthirdparty as a set of
pre-built binaries and associated headers.  This section provides the steps
and info used to build those binaries outside of TTP.


* Linux & Android builds
Building for Android and Linux is only supported on Linux systems.
The build script will build native Linux and all three supported Android
variants in one run.
The following prerequisites are known to be required:
    gcc (9.3.0 was last used)
    python 2.7 (3.x does not work due to upstream scripts needing 2.x)
    python "setuptools" installed to be used by the python interpreter
    Android NDK (version as dictated by existing takthirdparty prerequisites)
    
* Windows builds
Building for Windows is only supported on Windows.
Windows builds will only build for *either* win32 or win64 in a single
run.  To build both, repeat the build steps twice using a separate working
build directory for each and setting the script variable
(see step by step below) appropriately.
The following prerequisites are known to be required:
    takthirdparty itself must be available (used for Visual Studio scripts)
    python 2.7 (3.x does not work due to upstream scripts needing 2.x)
       (the cygwin package is known to work)
    python "setuptools" installed to be used by the python interpreter
       (the cygwin package is known to work)
    Visual Studio 2015

* Step by step instructions (same for both system types except where noted)
1. Create a directory somewhere to do the build.  It is recommended this
   be done *outside* the TTP tree.  These instructions shall call this
   "pdf_build" (but to be clear, any name can be used).
2. Copy the build script, pdfium-build.sh, to the "pdf_build" directory
3. Edit the top of the build script to set any options needed.
4. [Android builds only] Be sure ANDROID_NDK environment variable is
   set to your Android NDK location (see TTP instructions)
5. cd into "pdf_build" and run the script:
   cd pdf_build && ./pdfium-build.sh
6. Let the script run. 
7. [Android builds only] At completion you will have 4 .tar.gz files, one each
   for your native Linux, Android armeabi-v7a, arm64-v8a, and x86.
7. [Windows builds only] At completion you will have a .tar.gz file with
   named for the windows variant you built for. NOTE: if you need to build
   the other windows variant, repeat from the beginning with a new "pdf_build"
   directory.
8. Copy the new .tar.gz file(s) into the takthirdparty/distfiles/pdfium/
   directory
9. UPDATE THIS README WITH THE NEW VERSION STRING FOR PDFIUM!
