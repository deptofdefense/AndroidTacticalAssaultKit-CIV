-       b - Bits - Events in the "Bit" group carry meta information
-                  about raw data sources.  For example, range-doppler
-                  radar returns or SAR imagery represent classes of
-                  information that are "bits".  However, tracks
-                  derived from such sources represent objects on the
-                  battlespace and this have event type "A-..."
-
-                  The intention with the "Bit" type is to facilitate
-                  the identification of germane information products.
-                  This hierarchy is not intended to replace more
-                  detailed domain-specific meta information (such as
-                  that contained in NITF image headers or the GMTI
-                  data formats), rather it is intended to provide a
-                  domain-neutral mechanism for rapid filtering of
-                  information products.

                      The CoT event *how* hierarchy.
=======================================================================

    Hierarchy for how  attribute in base CoT schema

    * how (optional) format = character-character
        The "how" attribute gives a hint about how the coordinates were
        generated.  It is used specifically to relay a hint about the
        types of errors that may be expected in the data and to weight the
        data in systems that fuse multiple inputs.  For example,
        coordinates transcribed by humans may have digit transposition,
        missing or repeated digits, estimated error bounds, etc.  As such,
        they may require special attention as they propagate through the
        kill chain (e.g., they may require an additional review).
        Similarly, machine generated coordinates derived solely from
        magnetic sources may be subject to known anomalies in certain
        geographical areas, etc.

            h - human entered or modified (someone typed the coordinates)
                e - estimated (a swag by the user)
                c - calculated (user probably calculated value by hand)
                t - transcribed (from voice, paper, ...)
                p - cut and paste from another window
                g-i-g-o - a highly suspect track... e.g., TACP-M ;-)

            m - machine generated
                g - derived from GPS receiver
                    n - augmented INS+GPS
                    d - differential GPS
                i - mensurated (from imagery)
                m - magnetic          - derived from magnetic sources
                n - ins               - derived from inertial navigation system
                s - simulated         - out of a simulation
                c - configured        - out of a configuration file
                r - relayed           - same as m-p
**              R - radio             - radio positioning system (non GPS)
                    e - eplrs
                    p - plrs
                    d - doppler
                    v - vhf
                    t - tadil
                        a - tadil a
                        b - tadil b
                        j - tadil j
                p - passed            - imported from another system (gateway) w/o pedigree
                f - fused             - corroborated from multiple sources
                a - algorithmic       - prediction from an algorithmic tracker
                l - laser designated  - used laser range finder
P               v - computed using geometric means
P                   u - acoustic
P                   o - optical
P                   ou - combined acoustic and optical flash

     m-v-.* portion of how tree proposed by Jason Dunham (jdunham@shotspotter.com)
     in an email thread between Doug R and Mike B during Dec 2007 - Jan 2008.  
     No objections were raised to the proposal so I added to this file. - mel  

      As with other compound fields, the elements of the how field
      will be delimited by the field separator character "-".  E.g,
      A coordinate mensurated from imagery would have a how field of "m-i",

==============================================================================
                     The CoT event *qos* description
==============================================================================

    * qos (optional) - digit-character-character as defined below
        The QoS attribute will determine the preferential treatment events
        receive as they proceed through the kill chain.  The field has
        several distinct but related components.

        A "priority" value indicates queuing and processing order for
        competing events.  At a processing bottleneck (e.g., bandwidth
        limited link) high priority events will be processed before lower
        priority events.  Priority determines queuing order at a
        bottleneck.

            9 - highest (most significant) priority
            0 - lowest (least significant) priority

        A "overtaking" value indicates how two events for the same uid are
        reconciled when they "catch up" to one another.  The more recent
        event (by timestamp) may supersede the older event (deleting the
        old event) when it catches it, or it may follow the old event so
        that event order is preserved, or it may be routed independently
        of previous events.

            r - replace - new event replaces (deletes) old event
            f - follow  - new event must follow previous events
            i - independent - new event processed independently of old events

        An "assurance" value indicates how much effort must be placed in
        delivering this particular event.  Events from sources that
        continually send updates (blue force tracks) or that are sent for
        information purposes only require a lower level of delivery
        effort.  Events that are singletons (sent only once) and are
        critical require guaranteed delivery.

            g - guaranteed delivery (message never dropped even if
                delivered late)
            d - deadline (message dropped only after "stale" time)
            c - congestion - message dropped when link congestion encountered

         Thus, a valid QoS field looks like:

            qos="1-r-c"

         Note that different events with the same UID may have differing
         QoS values.  This enables a graceful degradation in the presence
         of congestion.  For example, a blue force tracker may output a
         sequence of events with like
            < ... qos="1-r-c" ... >  <= frequent, low priority updates
            < ... qos="1-r-c" ... >
            < ... qos="1-r-c" ... >
            < ... qos="5-r-d" ... >  <= occasional "push" priority update
            < ... qos="1-r-c" ... >
            ...
            < ... qos="9-r-g" ... >  <= A "Mayday" position report

                  The CoT event *link-type* hierarchy.
====================================================================

CoT has the concept of event linking.  Two events are related
(unidirectionally with no cycles permitted) in specific, hierarchical
ways.  The CoT relation type hierarchy is similar in structure to the
CoT type hierarchy.  Here is an abbreviated CoT relationship type tree:

          p - parent (of this object)
              p - producer
              o - owner
              m - manager
              l - leader (commander)
P             s - source (this object was derived from parent)
P             t - tasking (references the tasking that elicited this event)
          c - child (of this object)
              c - correlated element
              f - fused element
              a - alternate element
P             p - composite element
          r - refinement (of this object)
              a - amplification
              u - url (to be opened in web browser)
          t - tasking (by this object)
              o - object of tasking
              i - indirect object
              s - subject of tasking
              p - preposition 
                  a - at
                  b - by
                  w - with
                  f - from
                  r - regarding

CoT Type Value 'c':

   To be able to task someone to use any weapon, including the elements in the CoT type
   hierarchy, we need this 'c' branch.

   For example, the CoT type a-f-G-E-V-A-A-R means Armored Personnel Carrier Recovery.
   To be able to say "Engage the target using an Armored Personnel Carrier Recovery
   as the weapon", we would use the engage subschema as follows:

      <engage scl="c-a-f-G-E-V-A-A-R"
              target="HostileUid" />

Weapon Overview:

   - Rockets are unguided
   - Missiles are guided, often by a guidance system such as a laser seaker or radar

Howitzer Notes:

   - A self-propelled howitzer is mounted on a tracked or wheeled motor vehicle
   - A pack howitzer is a relatively light howitzer that is designed to be easily broken
     down into several pieces
   - A mountain howitzer is a relatively light howitzer designed for use in mountainous terrain
   - A siege howitzer is designed to be fired from a mounting on fixed platform of some sort
   - A field howitzer is mobile enough to accompany a field army on campaign

3 Ways To Describe A Weapon When Engaging A Target:

   1. Using a specific CoT entity as the shooter

         <engage shooter="TheShooterUid"
                 target="TargetUid" />

   2. Recommending a specific weapon to use against the target

         <engage scl="o-120"
                 target="TargetUid />
                 
   3. Recommending a generic entity (tank, Apache, etc...) to engage the target

         <engage scl="c-a-f-G-E-V-A-A-R"
                 target="TargetUid" />

                                     (Experimental!!)
================================================================================

The marking attribute is part of the area subschema.  This area subschema is a
Cursor On Target subschema to describe a geographic area in more detail.  The
marking attribute describes the physical marking at this area, such as a panel,
smoke, or fire.  The format is "type-color".

Valid values for type are:

    p - panel
    s - smoke
    f - fire

Valid values for color are:

    red
    orange
    yellow
    green
    blue
    purple
    black
    white
    gray

For example:

    type="f"          means fire
    type="p-red"      means panel-red
    type="s-yellow"   means smoke-yellow
