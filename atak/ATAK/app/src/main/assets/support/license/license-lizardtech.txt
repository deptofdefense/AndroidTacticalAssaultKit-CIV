the date executed by the later party to execute. 


RECITALS 

LIZARDTECH is party to a Technology Licensing Agreement with THE REGENTS OF THE 
UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA ('UNIVERSITY') through which it has an exclusive right 
to commercialize technology for storage and retrieval of large digital images, 
originally developed at the Los Alamos National Laboratory ('LANL'), including 
all patent rights arising under U.S. Patent No. 5,710,835 ('Storage and 
Retrieval of Large Digital Images') and certain foreign patents pending 
('TECHNOLOGY'). The U.S. Government and UNIVERSITY have certain reserved rights 
in the TECHNOLOGY as set forth in Appendix A of this Agreement. 
LIZARDTECH is engaged in the business of designing, developing, and marketing 
MrSID Decode SDKs (including the GeoExpress Decode SDK and the LiDAR Compressor 
SDK), computer software and related products arising from or developed based on 
the TECHNOLOGY ('DSDK'). DSDK consists of libraries that allow licensees to 
write software, or engineer a process, that enables end-users to view 
MrSID-formatted files and other supported file types. 
LICENSEE desires to design, develop or market software products that use DSDK to 
permit (among other functionality developed by LICENSEE) an end-user to view *. 
sid-formatted files and other supported formatted files ('Licensed Products'). 
In consideration of the premises and mutual covenants of this Agreement, 
LIZARDTECH agrees to license DSDK to LICENSEE for LICENSEEs use in the 
development of Licensed Products, and LICENSEEs subsequent sublicensing of DSDK 
with the Licensed Products pursuant to the terms and conditions which follow. 

1. LICENSE GRANT 
1.1 DSDK. In addition to the patent rights described above, DSDK and any and all 
associated media, printed materials, and 'online' or electronic documentation 
provided with DSDK are protected by copyright laws and international copyright 
treaties, as well as other intellectual property laws and treaties, and is 
licensed, not sold. LICENSEE shall not modify, reverse engineer, disassemble or 
decompile or otherwise seek to discover the source code or trade secrets of 
DSDK. LICENSEE shall not use DSDK to develop products or allow others to develop 
products that encode files into the MrSID format. LizardTech Geo Express DSDK 
License - 8 February 2010 Page 2 
1.2 Development License Grant. LIZARDTECH hereby grants to LICENSEE a 
nonexclusive license to install DSDK on a reasonable number of CPUs in LICENSEEs 
own facilities only for its own internal use and development of Licensed 
Products that use DSDK to view *.sid files. 
1.3 Distribution License Grant. Subject to the terms and conditions of this 
Agreement, LIZARDTECH hereby grants to LICENSEE a nonexclusive, worldwide, 
nontransferable right to distribute DSDK in object code format with the Licensed 
Products. For avoidance of ambiguity, LICENSEE is not permitted to distribute 
DSDK source code libraries. LICENSEE may distribute DSDK with the Licensed 
Products to sublicensees (and such sublicensees may further sublicense DSDK with 
the Licensed Products to other sublicensees) provided: 
(a) a notice regarding LIZARDTECH or its licensors ownership rights shall be 
provided with the Licensed Products as set forth in Subsection 2.2 below; 
(b) DSDK shall only be sublicensed under license terms as set forth in 
Subsection 1.3(d) below and any and all distribution of DSDK with the Licensed 
Product does not cause, or could be interpreted or asserted to cause, DSDK to 
become subject to the terms of any Open Source license, including but not 
limited to the GNU Public License; 
(c) any and all distribution of DSDK shall not (i) create, or purport to create, 
any obligations for LIZARDTECH or its licensors with respect to DSDK; or (ii) 
grant, or purport to grant, to any third party any rights to or immunities under 
LIZARDTECH or its licensors intellectual property or proprietary rights in 
DSDK; 
(d) DSDK shall be sublicensed to any and all sublicensees subject to a license 
agreement that provides LIZARDTECH and its licensors with the same protections 
and requirements as set forth in Sections 1.1, 1.3, 1.4, 2, 3, 4, 6.1 and 
Appendix A. For the avoidance of ambiguity, LICENSEE and any and all 
sublicensees may not sublicense DSDK separately from the Licensed Products. 
1.4 Rights in DSDK. LIZARDTECH and its licensors retain all right, title to, and 
ownership of all applicable intellectual property rights such as patent, 
copyrights and trade secrets in DSDK (including Updates as defined in Section 
2.3) and any associated documentation. Without limiting its rights in any way, 
LIZARDTECH hereby specifically reserves the worldwide nonexclusive right to 
develop, use, reproduce and distribute DSDK directly to other integrators, 
distributors and/or end-users. DSDK, including features and related information, 
are unpublished software, trade secret, confidential or proprietary information 
of LIZARDTECH or its licensors. DSDK is a "commercial item," as that term is 
defined in 48 C.F.R. 2.101 (Oct. 1995), consisting of "commercial computer 
software" and "commercial computer software documentation," as such terms are 
used in 48 C.F.R. 12.212 (Sept. 1995). Consistent with 48 C.F.R. 12.212 and 48 
C.F.R. 227.7202-1 through 227.7202-4 (June 1995), any use, modification, 
reproduction, 
release, performance, display, or disclosure of DSDK by the U. S. government 
shall be solely in accordance with the terms of this Agreement. Except as 
expressly permitted pursuant to Section 1.3, LICENSEE shall not rent, sell, 
lease, disclose or otherwise provide DSDK, associated documentation or any 
related information to any third party and will use such efforts, and in no 
event less than a commercially reasonable effort, to protect DSDK, associated 
documentation or related information as LICENSEE uses to protect its own trade 
secret, confidential or proprietary information. 

2. OBLIGATIONS OF LICENSEE 
2.1 Trademark Usage. LIZARDTECH grants to LICENSEE a nonexclusive, 
nontransferable limited license to use and display LIZARDTECHs trademarks, logos 
or other elements of its branding (collectively 'Trademarks') in connection with 
LICENSEES license rights granted hereunder with respect to DSDK, provided, 
however, such use shall be subject to the terms in the Trademarks: Limited 
License provision located in the Terms of Use at www.lizardtech.com. LICENSEE 
agrees to abide by such terms and LICENSEE further agrees to monitor the above 
referenced Trademarks: Limited License provision for any updates or amendments 
to such terms.

NEGLIGENCE, OR OF A LACK OF VIRUSES, ALL WITH REGARD TO DSDK. THERE IS NO 
WARRANTY OF TITLE, QUIET ENJOYMENT, QUIET POSSESSION, CORRESPONDENCE TO 
DESCRIPTION, AUTHORITY, OR NONINFRINGEMENT WITH RESPECT TO DSDK. 

4. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY. IN NO EVENT SHALL LIZARDTECH OR ITS LICENSORS BE 
LIABLE FOR ANY DAMAGES FROM ANY CAUSE WHATSOEVER, WHETHER RESULTING FROM LOST 
PROFITS, DATA, USE OR REVENUE, OR FOR ANY INCIDENTAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, SPECIAL, 
CONSEQUENTIAL OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH

APPENDIX A 
GOVERNMENT RESERVED RIGHTS 
1. Los Alamos National Laboratory. Some of the TECHNOLOGY incorporated in the 
Software was developed in part through a project at the Los Alamos National 
Laboratory (LANL) funded by the U.S. Government, managed under contract by the 
UNIVERSITY. The MrSID TECHNOLOGY, subject of U.S. Patent No. 5,710,835, is under 
exclusive commercial license to LIZARDTECH. The U.S. Government and the 
UNIVERSITY have certain reserved rights in the TECHNOLOGY as set forth in this 
Agreement. 
(a) The U.S. Government has a nonexclusive, nontransferable, irrevocable, 
paid-up license to practice or have practiced throughout the world, for or on 
behalf of the United States, inventions covered by the UNIVERSITYs Patent 
Rights, and has other rights under 35 U.S.C. § 200-212 and applicable 
implementing regulations and under the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) 
Assignment and Confirmatory License through which the DOEs rights in the 
TECHNOLOGY were assigned to the UNIVERSITY. 
(b) Under 35 U.S.C. § 203, the DOE has the right to require LIZARDTECH to grant 
a non-exclusive, partially exclusive or exclusive license under the Patent 
Rights in any field of use to a responsible applicant(s) upon terms reasonable 
under the circumstances, if LIZARDTECH does not adequately attempt to 
commercialize the MrSID Technology. See, 37 CFR 401.6. 
(c) LIZARDTECH maintains a discount program for sales of Software to the U.S. 
Government or any agency thereof or any U.S. Government contractor who certifies 
that its purchase of the Software is for or on behalf of the U.S. Government. 
(d) The UNIVERSITY may assign its rights in its License with LIZARDTECH. 
(e) The UNIVERSITY makes no warranty or representation as to the validity or 
scope of its Patent Rights, nor that the Software will not infringe any patent 
or other proprietary right and has no obligation to bring or prosecute any 
actions for patent infringement to protect LICENSEEs use of the Software. The 
UNIVERSITY has no obligation to furnish any know-how, technical assistance, or 
technical data to LICENSEE. 
2. Termination of LIZARDTECH Rights in TECHNOLOGY. Should LIZARDTECHs rights in 
the TECHNOLOGY under its license with the UNIVERSITY for any reason terminate 
during the term of this Agreement, such event will automatically operate as an 
assignment by LIZARDTECH to the UNIVERSITY of all LIZARDTECHs rights, title, and 
interest in the license. In such case, if LICENSEE is not in default of the 
terms and conditions herein, it may elect to continue this Agreement as an 
Agreement directly with the UNIVERSITY on the same terms.
