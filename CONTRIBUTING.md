## Getting Started

ATAK-CIV is an Android application and software development kit. 

## Making Changes

1. Fork and clone the project's repo.
1. Install development dependencies as in the BUILDING.md document.
1. Create a feature branch for the code changes you're looking to make: `git checkout -b your-descriptive-branch-name origin/master`.
1. _Write some code!_
1. Run the application and verify that your changes function as intended: `gradlew installCivDebug` and `gradlew installCivRelease` then launch the APK for the respective results.
1. If your changes would benefit from testing, add the necessary tests and verify everything passes by running the Test Report Task, e.g. `gradlew -Pcoverage createCivDebugJacocoTestReport`.
1. Commit your changes: `git commit -am 'Add some new feature or fix some issue'`. _(See [this excellent article](https://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit) for tips on writing useful Git commit messages.)_
1. Push the branch to your fork: `git push -u origin your-descriptive-branch-name`.
1. Create a new [pull request][pulls] and we'll review your changes.
