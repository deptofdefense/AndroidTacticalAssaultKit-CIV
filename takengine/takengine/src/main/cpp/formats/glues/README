TAK/PGSC modified version of GLUES 1.4 from
https://code.google.com/archive/p/glues/
Original GLUES 1.4 code is in accompanying tar.gz

TAK/PGSC Change List:
- Reorganize directories: source/* moved to root
- glu.h symlink to glues.h removed for compatibility purposes
- Add Android support definitions to main header
- Remove main source files and headers except glues.h as
  they are not needed for libtess
- Move libtess sources to main directory alongside glues.h and this file
- Change Windows API export/import defines to be no-op's since we're not
  building/using a DLL


What follows below is the original README content.

GLU ES version 1.4

This port is based on original GLU 1.3 and has original libutil and libtess
(part of GLU) only.

Warning, after gluCylinder(), gluDisk(), gluPartialDisk(), gluSphere() function
call, color, vertex, texture and normal arrays are disabled. Array pointers are
changed and must be reinstalled by caller to its original state.

Currently QNX 6.4.x native target build is supported and Win32 x86 build for
PowerVR OpenGL ES 1.1 emulator (http://www.imgtec.com).

Win32 build uses MSVC 2005 (9.0) and you have to change path to Imagination
Technologies PowerVR SDK in all project files.

History:

1.4 - Small fixes, regarding intermediate casts to double during equation
      calculations. Added Win32 build target for PowerVR OpenGL ES 1.1
      emulator. Added GLU ES documentation, based on the OpenGL GLU
      documentation with ES specific fixes.
1.3 - libtess and tesselation tests (QNX native and SDL 1.3) have been added.
1.2 - SDL 1.3 based tests were added.
1.1 - Removed some texture formats, which are not supported by OpenGL ES 1.x,
      added arrays manipulation to the quadric functions. Sphere flat shading
      fixes.  Disk texturing with inner radius more than 0.0f fixes.  Updated
      tests.
